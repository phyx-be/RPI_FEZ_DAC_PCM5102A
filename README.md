# RPI Fez DAC PCM5102A

The name Fez was chosen since these boards are small hats but do not implement the required circuitry nor are they mechanically complient with the [official Hat specifications from the Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats). 

This board adds a [PCM5102A](http://www.ti.com/product/PCM5102A) audio DAC to your Raspberry Pi of choice. This size fits perfect on an RPi Zero but it will work on full size Rasppery Pi boards as wel. Some headers are provided to quickly add some IO and communicate over UART or IÂ²C.
